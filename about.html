            <p>Every wedding is a reflection of the love, hard work and dedication of the souls involved in it. Our endeavor is to convey these emotions in its natural bliss to every frame we capture. These frames speak great volumes beyond time and generations.
                When others go behind trends, we at Weva strive hard to keep alive those precious moments without losing the happiness and intensity behind them.
                Each and every frame has a story to tell and our Stories from Weva are the memories that we create for a lifetime.

            <p class="bonheur-royale-regular">I took 10 months to write this review just to allow all the euphoria to sink so that I could write a very evaluated, non- emoted review.</p>
            <p class="bonheur-royale-regular">WEVA- after a deep-sea fishing to find the right people to capture the memories of the most important happening in our lives- Gayathri - Raghavendra wedding,  we landed at WEVA. I was initially very skeptical because they are from Kerala and ours is proper Tamil wedding. Though we had no doubts about their skills ( after perusing their works ), what made us to ponder was about the understanding of the cultural nuances of a Tamil wedding. </p>
            <p class="bonheur-royale-regular">When I contacted them, it was Ms. Mini who coordinated with us. She was so cozy and warm and from the word go, and she made me feel absolutely comfortable and assured that they are the right people for this job. </p>
            <p class="bonheur-royale-regular">The wedding celebrations were planned for over a week, starting haldi at our house ( Sattva) at Coimbatore and traveled to ECR for a pre-wedding party and then to Kuchalambal Kalyana Mandapam for the  Baraat and wedding. </p>
            <p class="bonheur-royale-regular">If I have to sum up their work in a single word, I can say it’s just a “Magic”. The priceless moments had been captured by the extraordinarily skilled lensmen of WEVA and edited and presented their fantabulous editing team into a lifetime memory. </p>
            <p class="bonheur-royale-regular">On the whole, we are very very fortunate to have identified WEVA to visually chronicle the most important event of our entire family. </p>
            <p class="bonheur-royale-regular">Dear Team HASH, thanks cannot be the word, your extraordinary a dedicated work is wholeheartedly appreciated. </p>
